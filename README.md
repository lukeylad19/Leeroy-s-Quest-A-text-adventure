# Leeroy-s-Quest-A-text-adventure
This is a text adventure game I made for my Interactive Fiction Engines course at SUNY Polytechnic Institute

In order to play this game you will need to have python 3 installed on your machine.
Simply run the "LeeroysQuest.py" file and the game will begin.
(Please not that all files must be in the same folder or the game will not run properly)
